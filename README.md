The covid19 statistics application includes:
Home Page
Table page (can be filtered and sorted)
Page with chart ( simple filter)
Dashboard with all the most important components (table,chart,global data)
I focused the main attention on technology:
React (Hooks,Routing,proper Components, proper fetch API).
-Responsiveness
Working with external libraries (Chart.js,Primereact,Material UI...).
-Local Storage
- Git
